 * Encapsulate reading/writing a header of a compressed file in Huffman coding.
 * Clients should ensure that reading/writing the header in the same way
 * are encapsulated appropriately. For example, the simplest approach
 * to implementing this interface is likely storing 256 int values (or, more
 * generally ALPH_SIZE values) in the compressed file, where the i-th
 * int value represents the number of occurrences of the i-th character,
 * e.g., for ASCII 65 represents 'A' so the 66-th value written would be
 * the number of ocurrences of 'A' in a text file. In general, since binary
 * files can be compressed, the i-th value written is the number of occurrences
 * of the int i in the data, where 0 <= i < ALPH_SIZE.
